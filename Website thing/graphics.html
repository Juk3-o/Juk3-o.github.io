					<h1>A-Level Graphics</h1>

					<p>Between 2020 and 2022 I took A-Level Graphics at college, in this course i managed to achieve an A* with my graphics project that took iconic Studio Ghibli characters and movies and turned them into posters and book covers inspired by other artists. I started with lots of experiments and finished with three final pieces.  </p>

								<div span class="col-2"><span class="image fit"> <hr> I started my project with some quick, rough concept art, I find for any project that you start its good to have a sense and feel of what you are going into. Here I took images from the internet, merged them together and painted over them this really helped in solidifying the idea for the project. <hr /> </span> </div>

								<div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Graphics/BookCoverThing02.jpg" alt="" /> </span> <p> I tried many different styles before ending up on a final one, all these were made quickly so i could find a style i liked.</div>
