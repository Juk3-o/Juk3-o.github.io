					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>I finished college in 2022 with an A* in Graphics and two Bâ€™s, one in 3D Design and the other in Computer Science. I have chosen to apply for Game design due to my high interest in the digital world and I think I am suited as I have a high understanding in many different programs and a passion for many different types of media ranging from film to videogames. I would say I'm interested in the entire process of game production, from the art to the programming to the actual design, games are like an amalgamation of everything I'm interested in, this is a large reason why I picked the A-levels I did. In Graphics and 3D Design I used digital techniques and processes, while in Computer Science I was given a better understanding on how these technologies work. In Graphics I used all sorts of tools and programs to create many different projects of different mediums. I have a high knowledge in Photoshop and Illustrator, not only did I use these programs in college, I still use them quite frequently outside to create my own projects. Illustrator for vector based art and Photoshop to create digital paintings, photo-manipulations, photobashing and just general photo editing. I also use a program called Aseprite to create pixel art and different assets for my game projects. 3D Design taught me how to develop a small idea into a final working project, I gained an understanding of 3D space through the program Solidworks. In my gap year I moved onto Blender and quickly picked it up, learning 3D modelling, basic texturing and scene composition. In Computer Science I learned how to program in Visual Basic and used it to create a working shopping system for customers and employees. I used the knowledge I gained from learning Visual Basic in college and transitioned to C# which I use daily to create the game I'm working on. In my gap year I decided to create a game using Unity. Inspired by other games of the same genre, I started work on a 2D pixel art metroid style platformer. Working on this game has increased my skills in programming, art and general game design in a very short space of time. I also have participated in game jams where you attempt to create a finished game in a day or two, this has quickly taught me about the entire process of making a game from conception to publishing. In this time I also decided to take a short course with the British Film Institute which involved creating a short film in ten weeks with a small group. Although this taught me alot about film making, what I took away from it was a better understanding of working together in a group and the learning process of creating a final product with them. In my spare time I like to keep active, in college I played basketball and was a starter on the first team. I also play the piano and work in my local supermarket, Waitrose. I started working there early August 2021, this work experience has increased my confidence and just all around given me a better understanding of a working environment. I am undecided what I would like to pursue as a future career but I think that this area of study will put me in a position whereby at the end of it I will be able to specialise in something I really enjoy.</p>
