						<p>I have been learning pixel art as it is an easy to learn but hard to master medium of art which works very well for 2d video games. Here are a few characters that I have designed, pixel art is good as it leaves a lot up to the viewers imagination to fill in the blanks. I have also made a bunch of objects and title sets, in my pixel art I use a limited palette which means I have a limited amount of colours. I think this is good as I really like limitations and restrictions in art as it means you have to think outside the box to really show what you want to portray to the viewer.</p>
